# VSCode Kill Ring

Emacs-style kill ring for VS Code.

Use `ctrl+k` to "kill", or delete, all text until the end of the line.

Subsequently you can use `ctrl+y` to paste that text. 

Or `cmd+ctrl+y` to view the history.

It's like a separate clipboard.

Had to make this because while MacOS supports it in text boxes, VS Code didn't seem to.
